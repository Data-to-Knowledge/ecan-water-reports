Repository for ECan freshwater reports
=============================================================

This git repository contains the documentation for the `ECan freshwater reports <http://ecan-water-reports.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

To be able to run the scripts, you'll first need to install the python environment using the install_env.bat in the "core" folder. Once the environment is installed, then you'll need to run the main.bat. Once that's finished, you'll need to push the output files to the github repo and the readthedocs will rebuild the site.

Please read the doc called `ECan freshwater reports <http://ecan-water-reports.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
